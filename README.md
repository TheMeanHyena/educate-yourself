# What is this?
This will be a repository to collect info material on the matter of transgender issues. 
# Why is this?
It started after I had a debate with someone on Twitter about whether you (as a progressive person) are responsible to answer good faith questions regarding these topics. I came up with the idea to have a repository for resources somewhere ready that can be referenced when engaging with these questions.
I chose github because I value the cooperation functionality of git and github is the market leader in these things.
# What are the plans?
For now I want this repo to be a place where they can discuss references and add more links to the repository. In future, maybe there will be some kind of website for this? I do not know yet. Please note that I have very little knowledge about managing and organising such a project and some help would always be welcome!
